If you are not ready to setup a GitHub account and run workflows, a &amp;rsquo;take-a-look&amp;rsquo; repository with the exercise issues and pull requests is available at take-a-look. You can follow along with the tutorial and read the issues and pull requests without having to run your own GitHub actions. Skip head to the exercises.
For those working through the exercises, this setup guide will take you though forking the tutorial, enabling issues, setting read and write permissions for workflows, and switching on workflows.</description></item><item><title>Create the Exercises</title><link>/docs/setup/exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/setup/exercises/</guid><description>There are two GitHub workflows for the tutorials.
