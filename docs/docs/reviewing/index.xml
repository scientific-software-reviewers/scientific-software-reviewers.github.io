The goal of code review is to be continually improving our code.
How do you tell if code is better?
Correctness
Readability
Design
Style
Functionality
Complexity
Consistency
Depending on your experience you may focus on one, many, or all of these.
The main question to ask yourself when reviewing code is:
Does the pull request improve the existing code?
Are there unnecessary changes?</description></item><item><title>Finding Community</title><link>/docs/reviewing/community/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/reviewing/community/</guid><description>You are not alone.
Building community and building great teams takes time, skill, and dedicated effort. Luckily, you do not have to start from scratch!
If you are the only person person writing code on your team, join an RSE organization and find your people.
US-RSE. A community of people who make research software happen. Society of Research Software Engineering which emerged from the successful grass-roots RSE movement and is the successor to the UK RSE Association.</description></item></channel></rss>
