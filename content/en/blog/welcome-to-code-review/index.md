Welcome to code-review.org, a project made possible by the Better Scientific Software Fellowship Program.
While the [tutorial exercises](/docs/exercises/ex_intro/) are intended to be a practical introduction to 
code review, the blog is a place to share practices and experiences of code review in scientific software. 
The goal is to shed light on coding in science, and be an informal place to share experiences: both positive
negative.
