Conferences can be great places to meet other research software engineers. Conferences can also
be prohibitively expensive. 

Here is a collection of freely available 'practice and experience' talks:

[2023 Improving Scientific Software Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur4I6kip-nY&list=PLbelYhZAAHEL1XdTWaz1adVwNdEhKONV4)
The playlist is for the 3 day conference. [agenda and abstracts](https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2023).
