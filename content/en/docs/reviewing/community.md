You are not alone. 

Building community and building great teams takes time, skill, and dedicated effort. Luckily, you 
do not have to start from scratch!

If you are the only person person writing code on your team, join an RSE organization and 
find your people.

* [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/). A community of people who make research software happen.  
* [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/) which emerged from the successful grass-roots RSE movement and is the successor to the UK RSE Association.  
* [Better Scientific Software](https://bssw.io/). A hub for scientific software development resources.  
* [Campus Champions](https://campuschampions.cyberinfrastructure.org/). Uniting Research Computing Facilitators
