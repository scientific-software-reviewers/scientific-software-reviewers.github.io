Welcome to Code Review. 

### What are the main learning outcomes?

When reviewing:  

* Does the pull request address the issue?
* Are there any deal breakers that would stop you accepting the changes?
* Can you suggest any improvements?
   * What is a good way to phrase your suggested improvements?
* Is the solution overly complicated? For an example of an overly complicated solution, see the famous [fizz buzz in Tensorflow](https://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/).
* Are the comments up to date, necessary, helpful?
* Would you except the pull request as it is now? Are your suggested changes must-do? nice-to-have? nitpicks? How would you communicate this?
* Do you spend a lot of time reviewing the code style?  Is it worth having a style guide for contributors? Can you make use of an existing style guide? Or a linter?

When workng on your own contributions:  

* When putting in a pull request, how can you make it easy for a reviewer to understand what you have done?
* What makes a good pull request, what makes a bad pull request?
* Can you commit code in a way that lets someone review your code more easily?  Should you separate functional changes from style changes?
Would you use a tool such as [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to prompt yourself at commit time? Why? Why not?

### What prerequisite knowledge does someone need?

Ideally, it would be good to have minimum coding knowledge to get started reviewing.  The text exercises make no assumptions about coding
knowledge. Variations in cultural knowledge always exist and it is important to have this in mind when writing or reviewing.
Text exercise 2 is an example of culturally specific mixup. 
Python is used by people across various domains by people with various scientific and non-scientific backgrounds.  The python exercises 
will be at the "introduction to python level" found in "learn python" tutorials. 
Fortran has a more restricted user base in terms of which domains people work in. These domains typically have numerical code. For Fortran
exercise 1, some mathematics knowledge is assumed.
