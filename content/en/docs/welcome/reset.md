There are two GitHub workflows for the tutorials.

`create_exercises` creates the exercises.   
`reset_exercises` clears the exercises so you can start afresh.  

If you would like to close all the issues and pull requests at once, you can use the `reset_exercises` action.  To get to the workflows, click the `Actions` tab
