There are a few things to look at when you first approach a pull request.
The title of the pull request and the description should give you some
information about what the author is proposing. 

Next, you can get an idea of how big the pull request is (and how much effort it will
take to review!) by looking at:

* How many lines of code have been added or removed
* How many files have been changed
* How many commits were made

These are circled below in pink.

The lines of code changed is show by the green/red +/-. In this case 14 new lines, 10 lines removed:
