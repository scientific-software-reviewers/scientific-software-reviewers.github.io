A pull request is a proposed change. 

There are a few things to look at when you first approach a pull request.

* How many lines of code have been added or removed
* How many files have been changed
* How many commits were made

These are circled below in pink, and these will give you an idea of how big the pull request is.

Each exercise has a pull request which proposes a change to the existing code. 
**Your mission is to review these changes!** You can read about the
reasons for the change in the issue linked from the pull request description. 
The issues contain questions to think about during review.
