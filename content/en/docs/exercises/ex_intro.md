There are three sets of exercises, all on GitHub. Follow the [setup](/docs/setup/setup) instructions 
to create your own tutorial repository to work on.

If you are not ready to setup a GitHub account and run workflows, a 'take-a-look' repository with the 
exercise issues and pull requests is available at [take-a-look](https://github.com/scientific-software-reviewers/tutorial-take-a-look).
You can follow along with the tutorial and read the issues and pull requests without having to run your own GitHub actions. 

For those working through the exercises, running the [create_exercises]({{< ref "/docs/setup/exercises.md" >}} "create_exercises") 
workflow will generate the text, python, or Fortran exercises in your fork of the tutorial.

The exercises are in no particular order. You can start with whichever seems the most 
interesting/applicable to you. Each exercise consists of a GitHub issue describing a problem
and a pull request which is a proposed solution to the issue. **Your mission is to review the proposed
solution.**

An issue may be a complaint from a user, a bug report, a request for a new feature. 
Pull requests may be from a colleague, or if your code is publicly available, from someone who
uses the code.
