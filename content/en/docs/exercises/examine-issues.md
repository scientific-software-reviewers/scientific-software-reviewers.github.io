An issue is a way to discuss, plan and track work on a GitHub repository. 

Issues can be bugs, complaints from users, requests for new features or 
added functionality.    

When reading though an issue, 

* Are there multiple problems reported in the issue? 
* Can you confirm the issue by reading the code or documentation?
* Do you need to run the code to confirm the issue?
* Can you reproduce the problem? 

Each tutorial exercise has an issue describing the problem. This issue
contains a link to the code under discussion, and some questions to 
think about when looking at the issue, the code, and the pull request. 

**Bonus points:**

Think about how you would like people to report issues with your own code.   
Would you use [GitHub issues templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
to prompt people to provide relevant information?

What is important information you would like to someone to give in an issue?

* version of the code being used?
* a small example the shows the bug?
* screenshots of the problem?
* error messages?
* desired solution?
* operating system where the problem occurred (Windows, Mac, Linux)?
